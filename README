This roll source supports building with different compilers and for different
network fabrics and mpi flavors.  By default, it builds using the gnu compilers
for openmpi ethernet.  To build for a different configuration, use the
ROLLCOMPILER, ROLLMPI and ROLLNETWORK make variables, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLMPI=mpich2 ROLLNETWORK=mx 

The build process currently supports one or more of the values "intel" and
"gnu" for the ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".  It supports ROLLMPI
values "openmpi", "mpich2", and "mvapich2", defaulting to "openmpi".  It uses
any ROLLNETWORK variable value(s) to load appropriate mpi modules, assuming
that there are modules named $(ROLLMPI)_$(ROLLNETWORK) available (e.g.,
openmpi_ib, mpich2_mx, etc.).

If the ROLLCOMPILER, ROLLNETWORK and/or ROLLMPI variables are specified, their
values are incorporated into the names of the produced roll and rpms, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLMPI=mvapich2 ROLLNETWORK=ib

produces a roll with a name that begins "cpmd_intel_mvapich2_ib"; it
contains and installs similarly-named rpms.
