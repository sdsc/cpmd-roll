This roll bundles the CPMD molecular dynamics package.  To install, execute
these instructions on a Rocks development machine (e.g., a frontend), starting
in this directory:

% make
% rocks add roll *.iso
% rocks enable roll cpmd
% cd /export/rocks/install
% rocks create distro
% rocks run roll cpmd | bash

In addition to the software itself, the roll installs cpmd environment
module files in /opt/modulefiles/applications/cpmd.

This roll source supports building with different compilers and for different
network fabrics and mpi flavors.  By default, it builds using the gnu compilers
for openmpi ethernet.  To build for a different configuration, use the
ROLLCOMPILER, ROLLMPI and ROLLNETWORK make variables, e.g.,

% make ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLMPI=mpich2 ROLLNETWORK=mx 

The build process currently supports one or more of the values "intel" and
"gnu" for the ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".  It supports ROLLMPI
values "openmpi", "mpich2", and "mvapich2", defaulting to "openmpi".  It uses
any ROLLNETWORK variable value(s) to load appropriate mpi modules, assuming
that there are modules named $(ROLLMPI)_$(ROLLNETWORK) available (e.g.,
openmpi_ib, mpich2_mx, etc.).
