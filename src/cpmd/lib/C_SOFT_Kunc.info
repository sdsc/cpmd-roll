Dear Pierino,

Jirka Vackar forwarded me your E-mail, and I just sent you the PP file
- my internal notation for that file is C_SGS_C206 and, for the paper,
I ran everything with the verions cpmd30.g on the T3E in Paris.

I sent the PP file from the T3E, directly, which is surrounded by armed
security guards on all levels, namely the one concerning all communications,
so in case you do not get it within minutes (or, say, until tomorrow)
please, scream out and I would re-send it by some detour.

I hope you will be able to reproduce the results shown in Fig.2,
there are abundant and explicit instructions in the "comment" section.
I suspect that the price to be paid for the softness is the cohesion
energy which, probably, will be more overestimated than with the other
pspts. (guessing this also from Fig. 2: from the energy at infinite cutoff
and from its position with respect to the other pspts.) - this is one point
which we did not test. If you get some qualified opinion (actually,
"quantified opinion") on this point we will be, of course, interested;
all 3 of us.

I hope that you are fine in Padova and I am sure that you are doing well.
Will I see you in Schwaebisch Gmund?

With greetings,
                Karel Kunc


Pierino, I forgot saying that I ran (cubic box with 8 at./cell) with
RAGGIO=0.8 ; with the other pspts. the optimal RAGGIO was 1.1 for SGS,
1.0 for Goedecker, 0.85 for Vanderbilt and 0.8 for Troullier-Martins
- but the differences were not big. I also tried TESR=2, only to find
that this is overkilling.

Do not make the exercises too difficult: if the students fail, it is
always the teacher who is blamed!

All the best, Karel.
